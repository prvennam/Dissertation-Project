My Dissertation research topis is:

"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigation of semiquinone intermediate in mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex"

As part of my dissertation work, I have analyzed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopic data and determined anisotropic 
spin distribution using Monte-Carlo simulations. In addition, I developed a non-linear regression model using MATLAB to calculate 
distance between two paramagnetic species (molecules with unpaired electron spin).

Here I have included a link to my dissertation. Please skip to page no. 112 to see the MATLAB code, 
but I highly recommend reading chapter 4 atleast for better understanding the model. 
I have provided text with the code, which makes it easy to understand. A big thanks to my advisor Dr. Michael.K.Bowman and my colleague
Matthew D. Kryzniak at University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa for helping me with the code and their support.
